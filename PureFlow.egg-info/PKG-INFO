2. Place the dataset file in the same directory as this cleaning tool.
3. Open a command prompt or terminal.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the cleaning tool and dataset file.
5. Install the cleaning tool using the this commands:
   pip install PureFlow
6. Import The PureFlow Package and start using It:
   from PureFlow import PureFlow as pf
   pf.clean_dataset()
   pf.remove_nulls()

## Parameters:
- `columns_name`: Provide the names of the columns to clean. Use ['all'] to clean all columns or ['column1', 'column2'] to clean specific columns.
- `remove_nan` (Optional): Specify if null values should be removed. Default is False.
- `save_it_as_csv` (Optional): Specify if the cleaned dataset should be saved as a new CSV file. Default is True.

## Output:
- The cleaned dataset will be displayed on the console.
- If `save_it_as_csv` is True, the cleaned dataset will be saved as "Cleaned_Dataset.csv" in the same directory.

## Note:
- Make sure you have Python and the necessary dependencies (Pandas) installed.
- Ensure that your dataset file is not open or locked by any other program during the cleaning process.

## Example Usage:
pip install PureFlow
from PureFlowTest import PureFlow as pf
pf.clean_dataset('dataset name', ['columns name'])
